# Project Documentation

## Project Overview

This project is a social media application built with React, enabling users to create and manage posts, interact with others through comments and replies, and explore various features related to liking , who likes and like comments count. In this project, I began with a pre-designed HTML and CSS layout. I broke the design into smaller components and converted each one into React components while adding functionality. For the database, I used a local setup to store user information, the current user, and posts

## Feature Details

### 1. **User Registration and Authentication**

- Users can register an account using an email and password.
- Login and logout functionalities allow users to access their personal accounts.
- Users can manage their own accounts and session data.

### 2. **Post Creation and Management**

- Users can create posts, which can contain text content.
- Posts can be set to either **public** or **private** mode:
  - **Public Mode**: Visible to all users.
  - **Private Mode**: Visible only to the user who created the post.
- Each post has a **timestamp** showing how long ago it was created.
- Users can **edit** or **delete** their own posts.

### 3. **Like and Unlike Functionality**

- Users can **like** or **unlike** posts, comments, and replies.
- When a user likes a post, their ID is added to the list of likes for that post.
- If a user unlikes a post, their ID is removed from the list of likes.
- Users can view the list of **who liked** each post, comment, or reply.
- Like counts are displayed, allowing users to see how popular an item is.

### 4. **Comment and Reply System**

- Users can **comment** on posts, fostering interactions and discussions.
- Users can also **reply** to comments, creating threaded conversations.
- Each comment and reply displays the **time** since it was posted.
- Users can like/unlike both comments and replies, with similar functionality as posts.
- **Reply likes** can be viewed by other users, providing insights into which replies are well-received.

### 5. **Privacy Controls**

- Each post has a **public/private toggle** that can be set by the user who created the post.
- **Public Posts** are accessible to all users, encouraging broader engagement.
- **Private Posts** are visible only to the post creator, ideal for personal or restricted content.

### 6. **Time-Stamping**

- Every post, comment, and reply includes a **time-stamp** that updates in real-time.
- This shows how recently each item was created, adding context for users.

### 7. **Data Persistence**

- All data (users, posts, likes, comments, and replies) is stored in **local storage**.
- This ensures that the user’s data persists between sessions, even if they refresh or close the browser.
